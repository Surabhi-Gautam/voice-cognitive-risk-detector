# 🧠 Cognivoice: Voice-Based Cognitive Decline Detection Pipeline

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **speech audio files** to extract **NLP and acoustic features**, applies **machine learning** to detect anomalies, and visualizes trends that may indicate **cognitive decline**.  
It's built using Whisper, Librosa, Scikit-learn, and runs fully in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗣️ Transcribes audio using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- 📊 Extracts NLP features: hesitation, word count, sentence length
- 🎧 Extracts audio features: pitch variability, tempo, duration
- 🧪 Uses Isolation Forest to flag cognitive risk
- 📈 Visualizes patterns via Seaborn plots
- 🧰 Optional: API-ready risk scoring function

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-cognitive-risk-detector.git
   cd voice-cognitive-risk-detector
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open `cognitive_decline_pipeline.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

4. **Provide your own `.zip` of `.wav` files** or test with provided structure.

## 🔬 Deliverables

✅ Clean and reproducible Python notebook  
✅ Sample visualizations of extracted features and anomalies  
✅ Optional API function to score risk from a single audio input

## 📈 Sample Output

| File                          | Pitch Std | Tempo | Risk Flag |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 03-01-01-01-01-01-01.wav      | 23.2      | 92.3  | -1 (Risk) |
| 03-01-01-01-01-02-01.wav      | 5.4       | 120.5 | 1 (Normal)|

> Pairplot of features shows separation of potential anomalies.

## 🧪 Risk Scoring Function (Optional)

You can use this function in a web app or API:

```python
def score_audio_file(file_path):
    text, _ = transcribe_audio(file_path)
    nlp = extract_nlp_features(text)
    audio = extract_audio_features(file_path)
    features = {**nlp, **audio}
    return model.predict([scaler.transform([list(features.values())])])
```
